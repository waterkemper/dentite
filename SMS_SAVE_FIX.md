# SMS Save Configuration Fix

## The Problem
After saving SMS configuration, the form fields were reverting to old values because:

1. **Credentials were being cleared immediately** after save
2. **loadSettings() wasn't preserving form state** properly
3. **Form fields were being reset** instead of showing current values

## The Solution

### What I Fixed:

1. **Improved loadSettings() logic**:
   - Only clear credentials when switching to 'system' provider
   - Preserve form values when using 'custom_twilio' provider
   - Better handling of encrypted credentials

2. **Fixed saveSmsConfig() flow**:
   - Clear credentials after successful save (security best practice)
   - Reload settings to get updated state
   - Proper error handling

3. **Better form state management**:
   - Form fields now show correct values after save
   - Placeholder text for existing credentials
   - Proper provider switching

## How It Works Now:

### When Saving SMS Configuration:

1. **User enters credentials** ? Form shows entered values
2. **User clicks "Save Configuration"** ? API call with credentials
3. **Backend saves encrypted credentials** ? Returns success
4. **Frontend clears form fields** ? Security best practice
5. **Frontend reloads settings** ? Gets updated state
6. **Form shows current configuration** ? Phone number and provider preserved

### When Loading Settings:

1. **System provider** ? Clears all credential fields
2. **Custom provider** ? Shows phone number, keeps form state
3. **Existing credentials** ? Shows placeholder text (encrypted in DB)

## Testing the Fix:

1. **Go to Settings > SMS Configuration**
2. **Select "Use Custom Twilio Account"**
3. **Enter your credentials**:
   - Account SID: `ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - Auth Token: `your_auth_token_here`
   - Phone Number: `+15672296814`
4. **Click "Save Configuration"**
5. **Verify**: Form should show success message and maintain phone number
6. **Verify**: Credential fields should be cleared (security)
7. **Verify**: Provider should remain "custom_twilio"

## Expected Behavior:

? **Save successful** ? HTTP 200 response  
? **Form updates** ? Shows current configuration  
? **Credentials cleared** ? Security best practice  
? **Phone number preserved** ? Shows saved value  
? **Provider maintained** ? Stays as "custom_twilio"  

## Security Notes:

- **Credentials are encrypted** in the database
- **Form fields are cleared** after save (prevents accidental exposure)
- **Placeholder text** shows for existing credentials
- **No credential display** in the UI (security best practice)
