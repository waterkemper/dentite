# Multi-Message Drip Campaign Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a flexible multi-message drip campaign system that allows dental practices to nurture patients with progressive message sequences, increasing urgency as benefits expiration approaches.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All planned features have been implemented according to the specification.

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Database Schema

**New Tables:**
- `campaign_steps` - Stores individual message steps in a sequence
- `patient_sequence_states` - Tracks each patient's progress through sequences

**Updated Tables:**
- `outreach_campaigns` - Added sequence support fields:
  - `isSequence` - Boolean flag to identify sequence campaigns
  - `autoStopOnAppointment` - Auto-stop when appointment booked
  - `autoStopOnResponse` - Auto-stop when patient responds
  - `autoStopOnOptOut` - Auto-stop when patient opts out

- `outreach_logs` - Added step tracking:
  - `stepId` - Reference to campaign step
  - `stepNumber` - Step number for reporting

### 2. ✅ Backend Services

**OutreachService (`backend/src/services/outreachService.ts`)**

New Methods:
- `processSequences(practiceId)` - Main sequence processor (runs every 15 min)
- `shouldStopSequence(state)` - Checks all termination conditions
- `stopSequence(stateId, reason)` - Marks sequence as stopped
- `completeSequence(stateId)` - Marks sequence as completed
- `sendSequenceStep(state, step)` - Sends individual step message
- `updateSequenceState(stateId, step, patient)` - Updates progress
- `calculateNextScheduledTime(step, patient)` - Calculates next send time
- `enrollPatientInSequence(campaignId, patientId)` - Single enrollment
- `enrollPatientsInSequence(campaignId, practiceId)` - Bulk enrollment
- `logOutreachWithStep(...)` - Logs messages with step tracking

**Key Features:**
- Automatic termination on 4 conditions (appointment, response, opt-out, expiry)
- Two delay calculation methods (fixed days vs days before expiry)
- Per-step channel selection (SMS or Email)
- Personalized message templates with variables
- Error handling and logging

### 3. ✅ Backend Controllers

**OutreachController (`backend/src/controllers/outreach.controller.ts`)**

New Endpoints:
1. `POST /api/outreach/campaigns/:id/steps` - Create sequence step
2. `GET /api/outreach/campaigns/:id/steps` - Get all steps
3. `PUT /api/outreach/campaigns/:id/steps/:stepId` - Update step
4. `DELETE /api/outreach/campaigns/:id/steps/:stepId` - Delete step
5. `POST /api/outreach/campaigns/:id/enroll/:patientId` - Enroll single patient
6. `POST /api/outreach/campaigns/:id/enroll` - Bulk enroll matching patients
7. `GET /api/outreach/campaigns/:id/sequence-states` - Get all enrollments
8. `GET /api/outreach/patients/:patientId/sequences` - Get patient's sequences

**Validation:**
- All endpoints include request validation
- Practice ownership verification on all operations
- Error handling for duplicate enrollments

### 4. ✅ Routes Configuration

**Routes (`backend/src/routes/outreach.routes.ts`)**

Added 8 new routes with validation middleware:
- Step management (CRUD operations)
- Patient enrollment (single and bulk)
- Sequence state retrieval
- Input validation using express-validator

### 5. ✅ Cron Job Integration

**Cron Jobs (`backend/src/jobs/cronJobs.ts`)**

New scheduled job:
- Runs every 15 minutes
- Processes all active sequences across all practices
- Reports processed, stopped, and completed counts
- Error handling per practice

### 6. ✅ Frontend Components

**SequenceBuilder Component (`frontend/src/components/SequenceBuilder.tsx`)**

Features:
- Visual step builder interface
- Add/edit/delete steps
- Drag-and-drop step reordering (↑↓ buttons)
- Per-step configuration:
  - Step name
  - Message type (SMS or Email)
  - Delay type (fixed_days or days_before_expiry)
  - Delay value
  - Message template
- Timeline preview visualization
- Template variable hints
- Collapsible step editor
- Step number badges

### 7. ✅ Frontend Pages

**Outreach Page (`frontend/src/pages/Outreach.tsx`)**

New Features:
- Campaign type toggle (Single Message vs Multi-Step Sequence)
- Sequence badge on campaign cards
- Conditional form fields based on type
- SequenceBuilder integration
- Auto-stop condition checkboxes:
  - Stop on appointment booking
  - Stop on patient response
  - Stop on opt-out
- Visual distinction for sequence campaigns

**PatientDetail Page (`frontend/src/pages/PatientDetail.tsx`)**

New Section:
- "Active Sequences" card showing:
  - Campaign name
  - Current step number
  - Sequence status (active/completed/stopped)
  - Next scheduled message date
  - Stop reason (if stopped)
- Real-time enrollment status
- Color-coded status badges

## Technical Architecture

### Delay Type Logic

**Fixed Days:**
```typescript
nextDate = new Date();
nextDate.setDate(nextDate.getDate() + delayValue);
```

**Days Before Expiry:**
```typescript
expiryDate = insurance.expirationDate;
nextDate = expiryDate - (delayValue * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

### Termination Conditions

1. **Appointment Booked**: Checks for future scheduled appointments created after sequence start
2. **Patient Responded**: Checks for any outreach log with status='responded' 
3. **Opted Out**: Checks patient preferences for email/SMS opt-out
4. **Expiry Passed**: Checks if benefit expiration date < current date

### State Machine

```
[Enrolled (step 0)] 
    → [Step 1 Scheduled]
    → [Step 1 Sent]
    → [Step 2 Scheduled]
    → [Step 2 Sent]
    → ...
    → [Completed] or [Stopped]
```

## Database Relationships

```
OutreachCampaign
  ├── steps[] → CampaignStep
  ├── sequenceStates[] → PatientSequenceState
  └── outreachLogs[] → OutreachLog

PatientSequenceState
  ├── campaign → OutreachCampaign
  └── patient → Patient

OutreachLog
  ├── campaign → OutreachCampaign
  ├── patient → Patient
  └── step → CampaignStep (nullable)
```

## Next Steps (Post-Implementation)

To use this feature:

1. **Run Migration** (Windows PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add_campaign_sequences
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **Restart Backend**:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the Feature**:
   - Create a test sequence campaign
   - Enroll a test patient
   - Verify in database:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM patient_sequence_states;
     SELECT * FROM campaign_steps;
     ```

4. **Monitor Cron Job**:
   - Watch console logs every 15 minutes
   - Check for sequence processing messages

## Performance Considerations

- **Cron Frequency**: 15 minutes balances responsiveness vs load
- **Bulk Operations**: Enrollments processed one at a time
- **Database Queries**: Indexed on `nextScheduledAt` and `status`
- **Error Handling**: Per-practice error isolation in cron job

## Security

- All endpoints require authentication
- Practice ownership verified on all operations
- Patient data access restricted by practice
- Input validation on all requests

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing single-message campaigns work unchanged
- ✅ `isSequence` defaults to `false`
- ✅ Legacy campaigns display normally
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing API

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- A/B testing framework
- Advanced analytics per step
- Sequence templates library
- Drag-and-drop reordering (currently use ↑↓ buttons)
- Message preview with sample data
- Sequence duplication
- Conditional branching
